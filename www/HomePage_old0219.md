# LymphMutSig – Lymphoid cancer Mutational Signatures

LymphMutSig is an interactive platform that provides a comprehensive atlas of mutational signatures in B-cell cancers and enables user-driven mutational signature analysis of B-cell cancer genomic data.

## Why do we build the app?

LymphMutSig was developed to provide a lineage-focused framework for understanding mutational processes in lymphoid malignancies. A dedicated, high-resolution reference for lymphoid cancers has therefore been needed.

## How do we build the reference of mutational signatures in B-cell tumors?

To build this resource, we systematically analyzed 929 paired tumor–normal whole-genome sequences spanning major B-cell malignancies. Using a unified computational framework, we characterized mutational signatures across multiple mutation classes, including single-base substitutions (SBS), doublet substitutions (DBS), insertions/deletions (ID), and localized hypermutation events (kataegis).

## What functions do the app provide?

1. **Reference Atlas** – An integrated compendium of mutational signatures observed in B-cell malignancies, allowing users to explore signature patterns, prevalence across disease entities, and associated biological features.

2. **User Data Analysis Portal** – An analysis module that allows users to upload their own lymphoid cancer samples for exploring mutational signature profiling based on LymphMutSig reference.
