Mutationcosine similaritytype	Signature	Putativcosine similarityetiology 	Overall prevalence	Description
SBS	Sig S1	normal endogenous processes in lymphocytes (lymphoid specific)	10,50%	S1, accounting for 10.5% of the SBS mutations, characterized by predominant C>T transitions. This signature showed high similarity to the SBS101 signature (cosine similarity=0.97) from the Signal database, which is prevalent in 68% of lymphoid cancers, and to SBSblood (cosine similarity=0.88), a recently identified SBS signature in normal human lymphocytes. While SBSblood exhibits additional T>C substitutions, both signatures share a predominant C>T pattern. 
SBS	Sig S2	dMMR	9,00%	S2, accounting for 9% of the SBS mutations, characterized by T>C mutations and displayed high similarity to Signal SBS26 (cosine similarity=0.94), which is associated with defective MMR. As expected, tumors harboring somatic mutations in MMR genes exhibited significantly higher S2 exposure than MMR-wild-type tumors 
SBS	Sig S3	POLH-like	8,50%	S3, accounting for 8.5% of the SBS mutations, is enriched in T>G transversions at the TW (W=A/T) motifs, showed strong similarity to Signal SBS9 (cosine similarity=0.99), which has been attributed to POLH-related mutations. Although POLH is reported to induce mutations at A:T base pairs in the TW or WA context during SHM, the mutation spectrum of S3 did not resemble the pattern observed in in vitro POLH experiments (2001cosine similarityJMBcosine similarityPOLH), which is characterized by enriched T>C mutations in the TW context. 
SBS	Sig S4	microenvironmental exposure	8,50%	S4, accounting for 8.5% of the SBS mutations, is dominated by T>G transversions substitutions in NTT regions and T>C transitions substitutions in CTT regions (Figure 2A), closely resembled Signal SBS17 (cosine similarity=0.98), which has been reported in multiple cancer types and normal memory B cells. Although the etiology of SBS17 remains unclear, it has been linked to oxidative damage in nucleoid pools or microenvironmental exposure such as gastric acid in resident tissues. S4 was almost absent in U-CLL and cMCL but showed comparable exposures in other subtypes, suggesting it may be linked to specific microenvironmental factors in GC.
SBS	Sig S5	GC-related  	8,20%	S5 is accounting for 8.2% of the SBS mutations. Although S5 showed similarity to the sequencing artifact signature SBS57 (cosine similarity=0.87), their mutational patterns differed substantially.  Unlike SBS57, which is dominated by T>C and T>G substitutions in TTT repeat regions, S5 exhibited additional prominent T>A mutations in TTW contexts. 
SBS	Sig S6	clock-like	7,80%	S6, accounting for 7.8% of the SBS mutations, resembled COSMIC SBS1 (cosine similarity=0.98, clock-like endogenous processes)
SBS	Sig S7	dNER	7,40%	S7, accounting for 7.4% of the SBS mutations, is characterized by elevated C>A, T>A, and C>T mutations, closely resembled SBS8 (cosine similarity=0.94), tentatively proposed to HR or NER deficiencies in the COSMIC. S7 exposure was significantly higher in NER-mutated tumors compared to NER-unmutated tumors, but only slightly increased in HR-mutated tumors than in HR-unmutated tumors, indicating a stronger association with NER deficiency (see manuscript).
SBS	Sig S8	dBER	7,30%	S8, accounting for 7.3% of the SBS mutations, is characterized by C>A mutations with peaks at TCT and is similar to Signal SBS18 (cosine similarity=0.92), which has been linked to BER deficiency. S8 showed significantly higher exposure in BER-mutated tumors than in BER-unmutated tumors (see manuscript), suggesting that this signature may result from BER deficiency. 
SBS	Sig S9	POLH	6,60%	S9, accounting for 6.6% of the SBS mutations, characterized by T>C mutations at TW motifs, exhibited features consistent with POLH-mediated mutagenesis. It showed similar mutational pattern with several reported POLH-associated signatures, including COSMIC SBS85 and 2001cosine similarityJMBcosine similarityPOLH (Figure 2E), moderate similarity to these signatures (cosine similarity=0.81-0.85, Figure 2F), and strong correlation (r=0.75, Figure 2G) with experimentally derived POLH-induced mutations43, supporting its association with POLH activity
SBS	Sig S10	clock-like	5,20%	S10, accounting for 5.2% of the SBS mutations, resembled Signal SBS5 (cosine similarity=0.85, clock-like endogenous processes)
SBS	Sig S11	dHR	4,90%	S11, accounting for 4.9% of the SBS mutations, is dominated by C>G transversions and a peak at TCT>TGT, closely resembled SBS3 (cosine similarity=0.87), which has been associated with HR deficiency, including BRCA1/2 mutations in breast cancers. Tis exposure was significantly higher in HR-mutated tumors, and showed no obvious variation across B-cell subtypes (see manuscript). 
SBS	Sig S12	dBER  	4,70%	S12, accounting for 4.7% of the SBS mutations, is characterized by C>A mutations with peaks at TCT and GCA and is similar to Signal SBS108 (q=0.92), which has been linked to BER deficiency.
SBS	Sig S13	APOBEC	4,30%	S13, accounting for 4.3% of the SBS mutations, is dominated by C>T at NCG trinucleotides, resembled SBS2 (q=0.97), suggesting its association with the activities of APOBEC family members.
SBS	Sig S14	Novel	4,20%	S14, accounting for 4.2% of the SBS mutations, is dominated by T>G in the GTT context and of T>C mutations in the GTC/TTC context. It represented a novel signature in B-cell tumors.
SBS	Sig S15	UV	1,60%	S15, accounting for 1.6% of the SBS mutations, resembled a UV-associated signature (COSMIC SBS38 and Signal SBS38)
SBS	Sig S16	sequencing artifact	1,30%	S16 is likely a sequencing artifact, as it exhibited prominent mutational peaks in repetitive nucleotide contexts (A[C>A]A, T[C>T]T, C[T>C]C, and G[T>G]G), closely resembling the mutational spectrum of COSMIC SBS51.
DBS	Sig D1	POLH (lymphoid specific)	31,50%	D1, accounting for 31.5% of the DBS mutations, is characterized by mutations in TT, AT, and TA, consistent with POLH-mediated mutagenesis in the TW or WA context (W=A/T). D1 exhibited high similarity to Signal DBS22 (q=0.82), a signature reported to be largely restricted in lymphoid cancer. , D1 exposure correlated strongly with the POLH-associated SBS signatures S9 and S3.
DBS	Sig D2	Novel	23,40%	D2, accounting for 23.4% of the DBS mutations, is characterized by TG>CA, TC>CT, and CT>TC mutations, and  shows no strong similarity with any known DBS signatures and could not be reliably decomposed, suggesting that it represents a novel mutational process 
DBS	Sig D3	out of GC	23,00%	D3, accounting for 23% of the DBS mutations, shows a dominant CC>AA mutation pattern and closely resembled Signal DBS13 (cosine similarity=0.94), a signature with unknown etiology that reported in multiple solid cancers.
DBS	Sig D4	GC-related 	22,10%	D4, accounting for 22.1% of the DBS mutations, is characterized by CC>TT and GC>AN mutations and resembles Signal DBS32 with unknown etiology.
ID	Sig ID1	dMMR	46,90%	ID1, accounting for 46.9% of the indels, closely resembled COSMIC ID2 (cosine similarity=0.99) and was characterized by deletions of thymine at long (>5) mononucleotide repeats, a pattern typically associated with defective MMR (see manuscript). Its exposure was higher in MMR-mutated tumors than in MMR-unmutated tumors and elevated in GC tumors.
ID	Sig ID2	aging+dMMR	36,20%	ID2 accounted for 36.2% of the indels and was characterized by both deletions and insertions of thymine at long (>5) repeats. This signature showed a high cosine similarity with COSMIC ID1 (cosine similarity=0.89), which has been linked to aging in non-hypermutated samples and is elevated in cancers with MMR-deficiency. The exposure of ID2 was also significantly higher in MMR-mutated tumors than in MMR-unmutated tumors.
ID	Sig ID3	Novel	17,00%	ID3, accounted for 17% of the indels, characterized by a >1 bp deletion involving a single repeat unit and 1 bp deletions of thymine and cytidine within homopolymers of length ³2, represents a novel indel signature that does not resemble any previously reported signatures and could not be further decomposed 
Kataegis	Sig K1	AID	52,10%	K1 was characterized predominantly by C>T mutations and was highly enriched in the well-known AID motif WRCY (W=A/T, R=A/G, Y=C/T). K1 was predominantly enriched in IGH S regions, and in the IGHD-Ecosine similarity, IGLJ-C, and TSS-proximal regions of ABC-DLBCL and BL.
Kataegis	Sig K2	POLH	46,40%	K2 was characterized by T>N mutations in the NTW (N=A/T/C/G, W=A/T) context, was enriched for the POLH motif TW, and showed a high similarity to the mutation pattern induced by POLH.K2 was more prevalent in IGK and distal TSS regions.
Kataegis	Sig Kapobec	APOBEC	1,40%	Sig Kapobec, accounting for 2% of the kataegis events. TIs mutations were enriched in the APOBEC motif TCN and exhibited a mutational pattern (C>T and C>G) that closely resembled APOBEC-related SBS signatures (cosine similarity=0.90 with Signal SBS2, cosine similarity=0.95 with SBS signature S13).
